# Numen Phrases

These are my personal phrases for Numen. They are still very much a work in progress. I am currently only playing around with voice and not using it for work yet. The goal is to learn another input method in case I need it in the future.

I picked Numen, because Talon does not work with Wayland yet (and is not open-source). Some commands are inspired by Talon.
